      Fortunately, you&#39;re wearing your trusty laser watch!
      You cut through the ropes in a matter of moments! James Bond you are not,
       however, and you manage to slice a sizable piece from your buttocks and leg.
       Still, you stumble to your feet, deactivating the laser. Or trying to deactivate the laser.
       The button doesn&#39;t appear to be working, and the beam swings wildly around, slicing hunks
       off the platform and your opponents. Fumbling with the watch, trying to get a better look at the
        watch in order to deactivate it, you direct it into your eyes, and sear a whole through your skull.
        Your brain cooks quickly, like a hard-boiled egg in its shell, and your body collapses, a brainless piece of meat,
         like the others in the room.
