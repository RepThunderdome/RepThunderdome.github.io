      You raise your fists to fight, but before you can take your stance, Santorum jumps at you,
      sailing through the air, and landing a perfect sidekick in the center of your chest. It passes
      through your chest, sending your lungs flying out of your ribs, into the mouth of a passing shark.
       But the momentum from the kick carries the both of you too far, and you land tangled in the razor wire.
       Your last moments are marked with the smell of ozone filling your nostrils, and the distinct smell of the manure
       Santorum had on his shoe before he drove it through your chest cavity.
