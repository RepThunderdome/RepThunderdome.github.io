      Seeing Santorum charging for you, you reach for the <font color="red">lucky hand grenade you always keep in your sock!</font>
      Wait a second, you don&#39;t do that. Who are you kidding? Military grade ordinance? You really think a civilian
       like you could get your hands on that? And besides, hand grenades are heavy. And big. There&#39;s no possible way
       that would fit in your sock. This doesn&#39;t occur to you until well after you&#39;ve reached down to retrieve your grenade,
        though, and Santorum, taking advantage of your crouched position, punts your head clean off. It sails into the shark pit, and is quickly devoured.
