      You charge head first toward the growling, spray-tanned Trump.
      You throw as many punches as possible; first a left upper-cut,
      then two quick rights to the torso, but nothing you try lands.
      Out of nowhere, Trump raises a giant bag of cash over his head and
      slams it down over your tired body, crushing you under its weight.
      Hundred dollar bills fly every where, along with most of your internal organs.
