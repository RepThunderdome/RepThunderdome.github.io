    <p style="color:white">
      You knew this was coming. You&#39;ve felt this fight ringing in
      your bones from the day you were born. And you&#39;ve carried
      exactly the weapon you need, ever since you were young enough
      to talk. You reach into your back pocket, and retrieve your
      Patented Great Looking Hair Spray (TM)! You let Trump charge
      at you, side-stepping at the last moment, and pulling his toupee
      from his head as he passes. He turns, steam spewing from his nostrils,
      face red with fury. He stamps at the ground, and charges you again. You
      jump atop his shoulders, and spray. You spray for all you&#39;re worth.
      His head, bald as a baby&#39;s, slowly begins to grow hair. His hair grows,
      from a short spray to a glorious mane. And as it grows, his rage slowly dies.
       &#34;This is all I ever wanted.&#34; He says, a tear in his eye. &#34;Clearly
       you are the better candidate. For you can give the people what they truly want.
       I concede.&#34; He withdraws, tears rolling down his cheeks.
