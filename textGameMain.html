    <p style="color:white">
      You enter the darkened arena. Floodlights flare, blinding you. Blinking, your eyes&#39 adjust,
      and the arena swims into view. Concrete floors, stained with blood and fenced in with razor wire.
      Beyond the wire is a moat, brimming with sharks. A scream focuses your attention. Around the arena,
      held back with chains, lie the first round of presidential hopefuls, mouths foaming with enraged spittle.
      A deafening loudspeaker blares out <font color="red">&#34WELCOME&#133; TO THE SHIT CANDIDATE THUNDERDOME! THE RULES ARE SIMPLE!
      LAST MAN, WOMAN, OR SNIVELING MANCHILD ALIVE&#133; WINS!!!!!!&#34</font> An air horn sounds, and the chains drop away!
      Bobby Jindal and Lindsay Graham jump on George Pataki, and rip off his arm! Shrieking, he stumbles into the razor wire,
      and the air fills with electricity! Rick Perry and Jim Gilmore, grappling with each other, trip over the side,
      and into the moat, where a tremendous shark flies into the air to catch them both in its mouth,
      sending a spray of gore and organs back onto the stage. And Rick Santorum charges you!
