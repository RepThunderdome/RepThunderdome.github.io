      You take a second look at Trump&#39;s corner, which you now
      realize is filled with solid gold baseball caps (all of which
      read &#34;Trump 2016,&#34; of course). &#34;Perhaps we could
      strike a deal, Mr. Trump,&#34; you venture. &#34;DO I LOOK LIKE
       A GOD-DAMNED IRANIAN TO YOU?&#34; he screams, lips permanently
       pursed. &#34;Or worse, OBAMA?&#34; A thousand golden caps rain
       down on you, battering what&#39;s left of your dignity.
