      You awaken to find yourself tied to a chair, hands bound, and head covered with a canvas sack. As you swivel your head,
       you hear the same voice over the loudspeaker. &#34;GENTLEMAN!!!!  WELCOME&#133 TO THE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE&#133 DIE-FECTA!!!!!&#34;
       The bag is ripped from your head, and you see Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, and Scott Walker all struggling against their bonds
       as the bags are pulled from their heads by ropes hanging from the ceiling. For the first time, you notice the intense heat
       radiating from edge of the wooden arena, and hear the unmistakable sound of lava bubbling below you. As you and the other
       candidates struggle, you feel the platform shift. It&#39;s balanced around the center, you realize. One wrong move will send
       all of you into the fiery pit below. You feel the heat flare as the platform behind you catches fire. Quickly, you shift,
       allowing the fire to burn through your ropes. You&#39;re the first on their feet! What do you do?
